Based on what you did in class, describe an algorithm to sort a deck of numbers

## Selection sort:
We all use the same method of sorting.
It was relatively fast but prone to mistakes and lost of tracking of the index being compared. The mistakes increase the time it takes to sort by a considerate margin.

## Merge sort:

Sorted list, time it took 2:53

Unsorted list , time it took 8:40

Sorted list, time it took 3:40<br>

Unsorted list, time it took 4:27<br>

#### Discusion:

Merging sorted list was extermely fast, since thiers barely any moving numbers, though thiers still a lot of steps needed in order to perform the merge sort. Comparing to the unsorted list merge, it took alot of time bacause thiers alot of moving numbers and together with the steps. When everything is done by hand its easy to loose track of the numbers.



## Lists Partitioning:

Time it took: 5:51

The time it took is 4:27 minutes<br>

#### Discusion:

Partitioning and sorting was really fast, almost as fast doing a merge sorted with a sorted list, less moving parts and less comparisons. Dividing it into parts made it easier too. And the method of not needing to lay it out made it easier to go through each steps.

For me, the best way to perform sorting algorithms on paper is to focus on the fact that both merge sort and quicksort divide the main list into two sublists: the left side and the right side. The most efficient and easier approach is to start by working on the left side, applying the algorithm to that sublist while ignoring the right side for the time being. Once the sorting process is complete for the left side, then move on to the right side and perform the same algorithm. After both sides are fully sorted, combine the two sublists to complete the overall sortin



## Fastest way to sort:

Laying out the papers visually helps sorting through the numbers, though it takes time to lay them out and moving them from to another. The other method used was pile them in decks instead of laying them out, like what we used in partition sorting. Thiers no visual aid with this method but it is much more faster and easier to handle.  The best way to sort the numbers by hand was through the partition method, the work is devided, less moving parts, easier to handle and takes less space. When other group members using the methods, they were a bit slower than me. Because I can visual the method in my head. But they can't visualize the same as I can with outme properly explaining everything. Though, the more they do it the closer then time they take them to finish to the time it takes me to finish sorting.
